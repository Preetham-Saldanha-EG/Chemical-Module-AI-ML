","Flash Point:14 F (-10 C) Autoignition Temp:855 F (457 C) Lower Limits:5.6% Upper Limits:11.4% Extinguishing Media:alcohol resistant foam, carbon dioxide, regular dry chemical, water Large fires: Use alcohol-resistant foam or flood with fine water spray. Fire Fighting Procedures:Move container from fire area if it can be done without risk. Cool containers with water spray until well after the fire is out. Stay away from the ends of tanks. For fires in cargo or storage area: Cool containers with water from unmanned hose holder or monitor nozzles until well after fire is out. If this is impossible then take the following precautions: Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry. Let the fire burn. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety device or any discoloration of tanks due to fire. For tank, rail car or tank truck: Evacuation radius: 800 meters (1/2 mile). Do not attempt to extinguish fire unless flow of material can be stopped first. Flood with fine water spray. Do not scatter spilled material with high-pressure water streams. Cool containers with water spray until well after the fire is out. Apply water from a protected location or from a safe distance. Avoid inhalation of material ocombustion by-products. Stay upwind and keep out of low areas. Water may be ineffective. Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:Severe fire hazard. The vapor is heavier than air. Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back. Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above flash point. Containers may rupture or explode if exposed to heat. ",,,,,,
